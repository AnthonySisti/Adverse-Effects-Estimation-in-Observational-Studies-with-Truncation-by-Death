• R Code for Simulation Study: R program that conducts the simulated case studies in Section 4.1
of the article on synthetic data. (Simulated Case Study.R)

• R Code for Data Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis: R program that conducts a similar
data analysis as the one in Sections 5 and 5.1 of the article on synthetic data.
(Simulated Data Analysis and Sensitivity.R)

• Synthetic data sets: Synthetic data sets for the simulation study (Synth CaseStudy X.xls) and data
analysis (Synth Analy X.xls) generated using the real data described in Section 3.
